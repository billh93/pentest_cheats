These are the vulnerabilities/exploits I have to check when I'm bug hunting. 
Note: This is not a final list. This note will gradually grow with more detailed information and instructions

1. XSS
2. Host Header Injection
3. URL Redirection


# XSS

Note:
* Use Burp Suite Spider to find all parameters on target site.
* Use a XSS Payload list with Burp Suite Intruder to speed up injections.
----------------------------------

# Host Header Injection

Example 1:
Host: victim.com
to
Host: attacker.com

Example 2:
Host: victim.com
X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com

Example 3:
Host: attacker.com
X-Forwarded-Host: victim.com

Note:
* Location header should show injected site.
* Some links in the page may direct to injected site so check links in page.

----------------------------------

# XSS Through Host Header

Example 1:
Host: victim.com"</b><script>alert('1');</script>

----------------------------------

# URL Redirection Through Path Fragments

Example 1:
Before - https://victim.com
After - https://victim.com//attacker.com/

Note:
* This will redirect users to newly injected site.
* Use Burp Suite Spider to find all parameters on target site.
* Use a XSS Payload list with Burp Suite Intruder to speed up injections.
